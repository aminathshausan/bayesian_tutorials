```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# R Markdown

This example is adapted from <https://atlas.cancer.org.au/developing-a-cancer-atlas/Chapter_4.html#carbayes_2>. We start by loading the __SpatialEpi__ package and attaching the _pennLC_ data.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
